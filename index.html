                    <p>In show jumping, athletes ride a horse over a set of jumps in numerical order, scoring penalties (also known as
                        “faults”)
                        if they knock down any jumps or the horse refuses to go over a jump. The winner is generally the athlete with the
                        lowest
                        score in the fastest time. It is a test of a rider’s skill and a horse’s ability. Each horse and rider jumps between 
                        12 and 15 numbered obstacles, known as a “track” or a “course” which takes
                        competitors in several changes of direction within an arena.</p>

                            to thirty-six fixed and solid obstacles. Obstacles usually are built to look "natural" (out of logs, for instance),
                            however odd materials and decorations may be added to test the horse's bravery. Obstacles can include all those that
                            might be found if riding across the countryside, including water, trees, logs, ditches, banks and ditches</p>

                        <p>“Hacking” is the term used to describe non-competitive horse riding that’s undertaken outside of the arena, usually
                            on
                            the roads or bridleways. Most horse riders who go on a “hack” will do so for pleasure, but hacking is also a great
                            opportunity to undertake training and fitness work. Riders will usually choose to ride on bridleways where possible,
                            but
                            often they’ll have to ride on the road to reach them.</p>

                        <p>Dressage is one of the Olympic equestrian sports. It consists of a series of compulsory movements, in walk, trot and
                            canter, in an arena measuring 60mx20m, where 12 lettered markers are placed symmetrically along the fence,
                            indicating
                            where movements are to start, where changes of pace or lead are to occur and where the movements are to end. The
                            judges
                            mark the fluidity, the regularity of the movements and the paces.</p>
