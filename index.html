                <h3>Show Jumping</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/show-jumping-mid-air-pexels.webp" alt="A person show jumping in mid air above the jump">
                <p>In show jumping, athletes ride a horse over a set of jumps in numerical order, scoring penalties (also known as “faults”)
                if they knock down any jumps or the horse refuses to go over a jump. The winner is generally the athlete with the lowest
                score in the fastest time. It is a test of a rider’s skill and a horse’s ability.</p>

            <div id="country">
                <h3>Cross Country</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/cross-country-jumping.webp" alt="A person jumping cross country and the horse is taking off">
                <p>The cross-country course is approximately two and three quarter to four miles (6 km) long, comprising some twenty-four
                to thirty-six fixed and solid obstacles. Obstacles usually are built to look "natural" (out of logs, for instance),
                however odd materials and decorations may be added to test the horse's bravery. Obstacles can include all those that
                might be found if riding across the countryside, including water, trees, logs, ditches, banks and ditches</p>

            <div id="hacking">
                <h3>Hacking</h3>
                <p>“Hacking” is the term used to describe non-competitive horse riding that’s undertaken outside of the arena, usually on
                the roads or bridleways. Most horse riders who go on a “hack” will do so for pleasure, but hacking is also a great
                opportunity to undertake training and fitness work. Riders will usually choose to ride on bridleways where possible, but
                often they’ll have to ride on the road to reach them.</p>

            <div id="dressage">
                <h3>Dressage</h3>
                <p>Dressage is one of the Olympic equestrian sports. It consists of a series of compulsory movements, in walk, trot and
                canter, in an arena measuring 60mx20m, where 12 lettered markers are placed symmetrically along the fence, indicating
                where movements are to start, where changes of pace or lead are to occur and where the movements are to end. The judges
                mark the fluidity, the regularity of the movements and the paces.</p>
