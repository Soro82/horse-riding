                <p>In show jumping, athletes ride a horse over a set of jumps in numerical order, scoring penalties (also known as
                    “faults”)
                    if they knock down any jumps or the horse refuses to go over a jump. The winner is generally the athlete with the
                    lowest
                    score in the fastest time. It is a test of a rider’s skill and a horse’s ability.</p>

                    twenty-four
                    to thirty-six fixed and solid obstacles. Obstacles usually are built to look "natural" (out of logs, for instance),
                    however odd materials and decorations may be added to test the horse's bravery. Obstacles can include all those that
                    might be found if riding across the countryside, including water, trees, logs, ditches, banks and ditches</p>

                <p>“Hacking” is the term used to describe non-competitive horse riding that’s undertaken outside of the arena, usually
                    on
                    the roads or bridleways. Most horse riders who go on a “hack” will do so for pleasure, but hacking is also a great
                    opportunity to undertake training and fitness work. Riders will usually choose to ride on bridleways where possible,
                    but
                    often they’ll have to ride on the road to reach them.</p>

                <p>Dressage is one of the Olympic equestrian sports. It consists of a series of compulsory movements, in walk, trot and
                    canter, in an arena measuring 60mx20m, where 12 lettered markers are placed symmetrically along the fence,
                    indicating
                    where movements are to start, where changes of pace or lead are to occur and where the movements are to end. The
                    judges
                    mark the fluidity, the regularity of the movements and the paces.</p>
