# Horse Riding

## Planning

## Introduction

The Horse Riding website is for people who like horse riding or who are interested in starting horse riding. It tells the user the different types of horse riding and gives some information on each type.

There are pictures in the Gallery page of people horse riding in the different types of horse riding. The feedback page allows the user to tell us what type of horse riding they enjoy.

## Features
