# Horse Riding

## Planning

## Introduction

The Horse Riding website is for people who like horse riding or who are interested in starting horse riding. It tells the user the different types of horse riding and gives some information on each type.

There are some pictures in the Gallery page of horses in the wild and people horse riding. The feedback page allows the user to tell us what type of horse riding they enjoy.

## Features

### Navigation

The navigation bar is in the top right of the page inside the header on all three pages.
The first link is to the Home page.
The second link is to the Gallery page which contains pictures of horse and of people horse riding.
The third link is to the Feedback page where users can tell us what type of horse riding they enjoy the most.

### Home page

The Home page has a picture of two horses running in the wild in black and white.
I chose this picture for the hero image because it is only 400KB in size so it will load faster than any of the other pictures.
In the top right corner is the navigation bar.

#### Main

The main section starts off with an unordered list of the 4 types of horse riding.
Below this is divided into 4 sections, 1 for each type of horse riding.
Each section has a paragragh explaining the type of horse riding and a picture.

### Footer

The footer section contains 4 links to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.

### Feedback Page

The Feedback page contains 3 labels and 3 text boxes for the user's first name, second name and email address.
It will also have 4 radio buttons allowing them to choose which type of horse riding they like to do.
There is a reset button to clear the form and and Submit button to submit the information.

## Responsiveness

The 4 sections on the main section will display 2 wide and 2 high on desktop view.
They will display in a single column for mobile and tablet view.
